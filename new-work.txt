Sql table update

Request Collaboration
Takes a collaborator's email and project ID, finds the user in the database, then creates a new collaboration entry in the collaborators table with a pending status. Returns the generated collaboration ID for tracking.
ApproveCollaboration
Updates the status of an existing collaboration request (identified by collab_id) to either 'approved', 'rejected', or 'pending'. This allows project owners or invited users to accept/reject collaboration invitations.


GetProjectCollaborators
Fetches and returns a JSON list of all collaborators for a specific project, including their status, username, email, and when they were added. Useful for displaying team members in Unity's UI.
GetUserCollaborationRequests
Retrieves all pending collaboration invitations for a specific user (by email), showing project details and owner information. Perfect for a "notifications" or "pending invites" feature in Unity.
